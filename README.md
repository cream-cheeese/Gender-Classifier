# Gender-Classifier
A gender classifier for portrait images. It uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to predict the gender of individuals in images. The classifier is trained on a dataset of portrait images and achieves accurate results. It also provides a user-friendly interface for predicting the gender of new images. A valuable resource for gender recognition tasks and image classification using deep learning techniques.

## Introduction:

The Gender Classifier project is a machine learning application that aims to classify the gender of individuals in portrait images. It utilizes convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to predict whether a person in an image is male or female. The classifier is trained on a dataset of labeled portrait images, enabling it to learn patterns and features indicative of gender.
This repository provides the necessary code and resources to train the classifier, as well as a user-friendly interface for making gender predictions on new images. Whether you are a researcher, developer, or enthusiast, this project offers insights into image classification and the application of deep learning techniques for gender recognition tasks.
